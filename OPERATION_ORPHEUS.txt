Promising Clues and Locations in the Hunt for Raxxla Polaris (Permit-Locked Enigma) – Polaris is a famous star system mysteriously locked off to pilots with no public explanation. In earlier Elite lore (Frontier: First Encounters), Polaris was the site of a Thargoid forward staging post containing alien transport devices guarded by INRA satellites forums.frontier.co.uk . While it’s unclear if any such infrastructure exists in Elite Dangerous today, Polaris’s legacy association with alien technology (even an alleged “gateway”) makes it a prime suspect antixenoinitiative.com . Next steps: Polaris remains inaccessible, but players closely monitor nearby systems (like Robigo, the closest reachable system antixenoinitiative.com ) for unexplained signals or mission hints. Any future permit unlock or narrative involving Polaris would be a top priority for Raxxla hunters, given the star’s history and the possibility that a Thargoid or Guardian portal could be hidden there. Shinrarta Dezhra & LFT 509 (Dark Wheel Connections) – Shinrarta Dezhra (home of Jameson Memorial) hosts the minor faction “The Dark Wheel,” a legendary group dedicated to finding Raxxla elite-dangerous.fandom.com elite-dangerous.fandom.com . This faction’s presence in a Pilots’ Federation permit system fuels theories that the real Dark Wheel or clues to Raxxla are hidden in plain sight. In fact, missions from The Dark Wheel sometimes involve odd cargo like “Trinkets of Hidden Fortune” and cryptic data deliveries elite-dangerous.fandom.com , which many believe are narrative breadcrumbs. Players initiated the “Turning the Wheel” project to expand the Dark Wheel’s influence, hoping to trigger secret events antixenoinitiative.com antixenoinitiative.com . A key target was LFT 509, a permit-locked system noted for having a gas giant with an eighth moon – matching the Dark Wheel’s mythical hideout description in lore elite-dangerous.fandom.com . Next steps: Continue supporting The Dark Wheel faction to expand into notable systems (e.g. Sol, Lave, Robigo) as theorized triggers antixenoinitiative.com antixenoinitiative.com . If LFT 509 or similar “hidden” systems ever open, explorers should immediately search for outposts or beacon signals on any 8th moon or station – it could be the fabled Dark Wheel base or a map leading to Raxxla. Col 285 Sector BG-O d6-93 – “Delta 69” Anomaly – This unassuming system hides Communication Array Delta 69, an abandoned Odyssey settlement with unsettling logs canonn.science canonn.science . The crew discovered a “mysterious body” that appeared out of nowhere and did not belong to any known personnel canonn.science . Soon after, they detected a strange signal ~10 km away and a gravitational anomaly (~0.1g) with no visible source on the planet’s surface canonn.science . Their logs describe an unseen massive object emitting the signal – as if something phased in from witch-space or a hidden dimension. The situation worsened when the corpse briefly reanimated (“he opened his eyes…signal coming from him”) and the entire team vanished without a trace canonn.science canonn.science . Recovery crews found the base intact but no crew or bodies, as if they were whisked away. Next steps: This site hints at dimensional or portal-like phenomena, exactly the kind of occurrence Raxxla lore predicts (“whisperer in witch-space” and a “siren of the deepest void” elite-dangerous.fandom.com ). Commanders can visit Col 285 Sector BG-O d6-93 and scan for any remaining abnormal readings – for instance, mapping the exact spot of the phantom mass or analyzing the signal data (if any can be reconstructed from log clues). The unexplained nature of the “ghost signal” and invisible object invites experiments: players might bring a Thargoid Sensor or Guardian artifact to the site to see if it reacts, or perform SRV geological scans at the anomaly coordinates. Any new clue from this mystery site could point toward technology or phenomena related to Raxxla (e.g. a miniature wormhole or Omphalos device testing ground). Nefertem (Generation Ship Thetis – Ghost Signal) – The Thetis is an antique generation ship found derelict in Nefertem 6 a’s orbit canonn.science , and it’s the source of one of the galaxy’s eeriest unexplained events. Logs reveal the Thetis picked up a whispering transmission of unknown origin that propagated through its comm systems canonn.science canonn.science . This digital “siren song” drove the inhabitants violently insane – the message, once decrypted, was just a repeating whisper: “...kill them all…” canonn.science . The signal originated from an uninhabited planet the ship had passed ~15 ly earlier canonn.science , but how it infected the Thetis’s systems remains unknown. Crew members scrawled alien writing in blood and slaughtered each other until the colony ship went silent canonn.science . Many draw parallels between this and the “whisperer in witch-space” from the Dark Wheel toast – suggesting the signal could be a lure or guardian mechanism related to Raxxla elite-dangerous.fandom.com . Next steps: Investigate the Nefertem system and surrounding 15 ly radius for any planets or installations that could have transmitted the deadly message. It may be worthwhile to scan Nefertem’s bodies for unusual radiation or to search nearby systems (via listening posts or DSS probes) for a dormant beacon matching the Thetis’s timestamp. Solving the source of the ghost signal – whether it was an AI experiment, a Thargoid/Guardian artifact, or something even stranger – could provide insight into the kind of “mind trap” technology that might guard Raxxla’s secret. Formidine Rift – Syreadiae JX-F c0 (“Zurara” Megaship) – The Formidine Rift is a vast, star-sparse region (far from Sol) entwined with dark conspiracies. In 3303, players followed an obscure trail of clues to discover the derelict megaship Zurara in Syreadiae JX-F c0 canonn.science . Its log recordings unveiled “Project Dynasty,” a covert operation by a shadowy cabal (hinted to be The Club) to seed deep-space with human outposts – and then eliminate the crews canonn.science canonn.science . The Zurara’s crew were sabotaged and left to die after deploying beacons and terraforming devices around distant worlds canonn.science . Hauntingly, the last log speaks of the Rift being “haunted by ghosts”… and the crew realizing they became the ghosts haunting the region canonn.science . This sinister effort was meant to keep something secret out there. Notably, each Dynasty beacon’s clue was hidden via a poetic cipher, showing how lore can be concealed in riddles canonn.science . Many believe the Formidine Rift saga was an elaborate prelude, possibly pointing toward Raxxla or its guardians. Next steps: Explorers should re-examine the Dynasty sites in the Rift, Conflux, and Hawking’s Gap, looking for any overlooked messages or coordinates. The Zurara’s logs mentioned preparing Earth-like worlds “for no known reason” canonn.science – perhaps one of those planets hides an “Omphalos” device or portal. Using the detailed galactic coordinates from the Dynasty beacons, one could triangulate if they form a geometric pattern or point toward a central location in the Formidine Rift (some theorize a figurative “X marks the spot”). Continuing to scour the uncharted systems in the Rift for any permit-locked pockets or unexplained phenomena is prudent – the answer to what “haunts” the Rift might be the biggest treasure of all. HIP 22460 (Guardian-Thargoid “Proteus” Site) – HIP 22460 became infamous in 3308 as the site of Salvation’s Proteus Wave device – a superweapon built by human scientists using Guardian technology to eradicate Thargoids canonn.science . The attempt backfired catastrophically: the Thargoids not only survived but seemingly evolved, and HIP 22460 is now permanently enveloped in an ominous residue (an orange cloud of unknown energy) that disables Guardian-based modules. This system is essentially a graveyard of capital ships surrounding an ancient Thargoid ground site where the Proteus Wave was deployed. The significance for Raxxla hunters is twofold: First, HIP 22460 proved that hybrid tech (Guardian + Thargoid) can yield galaxy-altering effects, hinting that a portal or dimensional weapon could be possible. Second, the fallout from the event changed Thargoid behavior and perhaps revealed how fiercely they guard certain locations. Next steps: Commanders brave enough to visit HIP 22460 can investigate the Thargoid structure on planet 10b where the Proteus Wave was activated. With on-foot exploration, one can search for any newly exposed caverns or devices in the ruins (after the Wave’s blast) that might not have been there before. Given that the Proteus Wave was essentially an attempt to control space-time against Thargoids, it’s worth testing whether any Guardian keys or “relics” react differently in HIP 22460’s vicinity now. This system serves as a cautionary tale but also a beacon: if there is any “dimensional door” technology in Elite’s lore (as Raxxla is rumored to be), a place where Guardian and Thargoid power clashed at such scale is a prime candidate for residual clues. Thargoid Surface Sites & the “Grelic” Hybrid Artifacts – Across various systems (especially in the Pleiades, Coalsack, and Witch Head regions), ancient Thargoid ground sites house strange “devices” in their center. After the events of 3308, these sites began exhibiting a new phenomenon: if a Guardian Relic is placed into a Thargoid device, it triggers a reaction that converts the relic into an Unclassified Relic (dubbed a *“Green Relic” or Grelic by pilots) canonn.science canonn.science . These glowing green artifacts carry both Guardian and Thargoid energy signatures. Engineers like Ram Tah and Prof. Palin took interest, suggesting such items could be keys to new technology canonn.science . So far, Grelics have known uses (they’re a component in the Thargoid Pulse Neutralizer for accessing mothership interiors canonn.science ), but their full purpose remains enigmatic. The fact that Guardian sites and Thargoid sites can interface at all implies someone (or something) engineered this compatibility – possibly as part of an ancient guardian AI’s plan or a failsafe. Next steps: Collect Unclassified Relics from multiple Thargoid sites and experiment with them in different contexts. For example, take a Grelic to Guardian Ruins or Beacons to see if any dormant Guardian machinery responds. Thus far, none of the Guardian structures have visibly reacted to Grelics canonn.science , but perhaps the right site (maybe a Guardian AI hub if one exists) could “wake up” when presented with this hybrid key. Some commanders even speculate that Raxxla itself might require both alien civilizations’ tech to unlock – for instance, activating an ancient portal might demand a Guardian relic corrupted with Thargoid energy. Community theories have gone so far as to suggest a rogue Guardian AI (“the Construct”) used a gateway like Raxxla to escape our galaxy reddit.com . If that’s remotely true, then pursuing any lead where Guardian and Thargoid science converge (like these Grelic-producing sites) is critical. HIP 87621 (October Consortium Mystery System) – HIP 87621 is a recently highlighted system that had long been permit-locked without public reason. In mid-3311, a missing-explorer storyline drew attention here: Scientist Terri Tora vanished after claiming to find “something big” in HIP 87621 canonn.science canonn.science . Her trail, uncovered through coded beacon messages, confirmed her final destination was indeed this locked system canonn.science . Galnet news reported “unusual planetary signatures” detected from long-range scans of HIP 87621, puzzling experts canonn.science . This stirred all major powers and even entrepreneur Zachary Rackham to fund investigations, given speculation that HIP 87621 holds unique life or xenotech canonn.science canonn.science . The permit owner turned out to be a private group called October Consortium, which claims they’re conducting “ongoing studies” and will release findings later canonn.science canonn.science . The secrecy and sudden flurry of interest suggest something potentially paradigm-shifting is hidden there (perhaps a one-of-a-kind planet or device). Next steps: Although independent pilots still cannot enter HIP 87621 canonn.science , the surrounding space can be combed for leaks. Monitor megaship traffic: two research vessels, The Cygnus and The Orion, jumped into HIP 87621 recently canonn.science – their departures might carry clues or cargo that can be intercepted. Explorers should also use the hint from Rackham’s initiative: search the galaxy for similar anomalous planets. If HIP 87621 has an unprecedented signal (e.g. an organic signature or a gravitational anomaly), finding a matching signature elsewhere could both validate its nature and lead to areas the October Consortium might have missed. In short, HIP 87621 is a “new Raxxla candidate” on the block – a mysterious locked box. Solving its secret, whether it be a unique exobiological find or a hidden construct, could unveil a new facet of the lore. At minimum, it proves that undisclosed permit systems are still being used to hide discoveries, renewing hope that one of them could conceal Raxxla. “Omphalos Rift” and Princess Astrophel (Dimensional Portal Lore) – No hunt for Raxxla can ignore the legend’s most fantastical element: the idea that Raxxla is not just a place, but a gateway to other universes. The in-game codex notes that some Raxxla tales include an alien artifact called the Omphalos Rift, described as a tunnel through which parallel universes can be reached elite-dangerous.fandom.com . This was popularized (and half-discredited) by a 3270s children’s book, “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars,” which seems to allegorize Raxxla’s myth. Intriguingly, lore-hounds suspect the author may have embedded real clues in the whimsical story for those “with eyes to see” elite-dangerous.fandom.com . The very name “Omphalos” means navel or center – could hint at the galactic core or a specific coordinate nexus. Meanwhile, the Dark Wheel toast’s poetic lines (“jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies… whisperer in witch-space… lover’s woe…”) have fueled countless interpretations elite-dangerous.fandom.com . Some interpret the “mother of galaxies” as the Andromeda galaxy (visible as a smudge in our skies), with Raxxla as a jewel on its brow – implying a line-of-sight alignment or a literal gateway there. Others link “lover’s woe” and “parent’s grief” to celestial objects named for mythic lovers or children. Next steps: Investigating this dimension-travel aspect means thinking outside the box of standard exploration. One approach is to analyze star maps for patterns – for example, plotting all permit-locked or otherwise significant mystery sites to see if they form a constellation or geometric shape when viewed from a certain vantage (could Raxxla lie at the focal point of such a pattern?). Another approach is audio and spectral analysis: past mysteries (the Unknown Probe, Dynasty probes, etc.) hid data in audio spectrograms and riddles. It’s worth revisiting the Dark Wheel toast and the Princess Astrophel story for cipher patterns – perhaps numerical codes (the letters might correspond to catalog star IDs) or tonal hints (a “spiraling star” could refer to a real spiral galaxy or nebula coordinates). Additionally, any mention of a gateway or portal tech in Guardian or Thargoid lore should be cross-referenced with known systems. If Raxxla truly is an open door to the multiverse, the trigger to find it might not be scanning a nav beacon but performing a specific action or sequence (much like activating a Guardian site). Commanders have even speculated about the need for an AI co-pilot or conscious ship to navigate to Raxxla’s location, given phrases like “whisperer in witch-space” – perhaps an intelligent onboard computer (or even a Thargoid Scout under human control) could perceive a hidden signal in hyperspace. While these ideas are unproven, the dimensional aspect of Raxxla means explorers must be creative: watch for any glitch in witch-space, decode every nursery rhyme and myth for coordinates, and be prepared that Raxxla might not be reachable by a simple jump but through a gateway mechanism waiting to be unlocked by the right key. <br> In summary, the search for Raxxla and related secrets spans the spectrum from concrete anomalies (e.g. unexplained mass signals, ghost ships) to interpretive lore puzzles (poems, songs, and symbols). The locations above – permit-locked systems without explanation, sites of alien-human interaction, and places steeped in legend – are among the most promising leads. Each comes with supporting lore (from canonical Codex entries to in-game logs) and offers testable hypotheses for commanders in Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Whether it’s delivering a strange hybrid relic to a ancient ruin, cracking a cipher hidden in a tourist beacon, or simply being the first to set foot on a virgin world in a locked sector, any of these paths could nudge the door open. The galaxy’s greatest mystery has endured for years, but with new threads emerging and players’ collective knowledge growing, the trail to Raxxla is warmer than ever. As one Dark Wheel saying goes, “the yearning of our vagabond hearts” drives us onward elite-dangerous.fandom.com – and the next discovery could be the one that finally turns that yearning into reality.
